Detailed analysis can be found in the "Practical Application 1" file


*Conclusions*
1) Age is the best predictor, with younger users being the most likely to redeem the coupon. This has a slight asterisk, as the N for below 21 was the smallest age category studied, but had the highest likelihood. Generally, this implies that targetting a younger crowd to be a valuable segment of the market to pursue.
2) Frequency seems to have a nearly binary split between "never" and "more than once." It would be advisable to target potential customers who visit a coffeeshop at least once per month   
3) Income does not seem to be a good predictor of likelihood to redeem coupon.
   

*Questions Moving Forward*

One possible explanation for the core finding is that younger users are more likely to anticipate using the voucher, but that might not materialize in the real world. 
2) What is the lifetime value of these customers? Are those who redeem the coupon likely to become loyal customers, and if so, does that very across the different splits of drivers
3)
